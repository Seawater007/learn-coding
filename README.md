# Coding journey

I was trying to find a good way to learn programming, but I think for now the best way is to write and understand the code line by line. 

I am using Windows OS for coding as of Apr3-2024. In the future, I might change into something else. So the way to create files and the way to commit is being done through cmd, WSL Ubuntu and vscode for now. 

I am learning, and there is the research idea on the way to learn and write program in human language. I think the language we use for thoughts and communication will be used to write program in the future. I know there are benefits in using programming language, but the learning curve is an issues for most developers. I hope my research could produce something. 

Well, enough talking about what I will do, I need to take action. 

## What is this repo is all about? 

Well, I will use it as a way to save all my coding journey, and transfer the code across devices. From learning in the classroom and others coding tasks, I will keep it in here.
