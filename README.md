# Coding journey

I was trying to find a good way to learn programming, but I think for now the best way to write and understand line by line. 

I am using Windows OS for coding as of Apr3-2024. In the future, I might change into something else. So the way to create files and the way to commit is being done through cmd for now and vscode for now. 

This is good, I am learning. I am researching on a way to learn and write program in human language, the language we use for thoughts and communicate. I know there are benefits in using programming language, but the learning curve is still here. I hope my research could produce something.
