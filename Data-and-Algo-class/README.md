// 1. Create an array of 5 integer elements. Create pointer ptr1 that points to the 3rd element of the array. Modify the value pointed by ptr1 by multiplying it by 10. Show the array value.

// 2. Write a program that finds the sum of all elements in an integer array using pointers

// 3. Write a program that reverses the elements of an array using pointers

// 4. Write a program that multiplies each element of an array by 2 using pointers 

/*
5. Create an array of 5 integer elements. Use 2 pointers to propagate from left to right and right to left. 
If the value is an odd, the pointer jump by one. 
If the value is even, the pointer jumps by two.
Show the array and address of each element.
When pointers point to the same value, print the value.
When pointers pass by each other, print the values and address both pointer pointed to.
