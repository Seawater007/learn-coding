Absolutely, here's a line-by-line explanation of the code for a doubly linked list with right-to-left traversal:

**1. Comments (`//double linked list // traversal from right to left`)**
- These lines are comments that don't affect the code execution but provide information about the purpose of the code: it implements a doubly linked list and allows for traversal from the rightmost node to the leftmost.

**2. Header Inclusion (`#include <iostream>`)**
- This line includes the `iostream` header file, providing input/output functionalities like `cout` (used for printing to the console).

**3. Namespace (`using namespace std;`)**
- This line brings the `std` namespace into scope, allowing you to use standard C++ objects like `cout` without the `std::` prefix.

**4. Node Structure Definition (`struct Node`)**
- This code defines a structure named `Node` that serves as the building block of the doubly linked list.
   - `data`: An integer member variable to store the actual data value of a node.
   - `prev`: A pointer to a `Node` object, representing the previous element in the linked list, enabling traversal from right to left.
   - `next`: Another pointer to a `Node` object, pointing to the next element in the linked list (not used in this specific traversal).

**5. Function `addNode` (`void addNode(Node*& head, int key)`)**
   - This function adds a new node with the value `key` to the beginning of the doubly linked list, effectively making it a right-to-left insertion.
     - `Node*& head`: The function takes a reference to the head pointer of the linked list (`head`). This allows the function to modify the `head` pointer itself from within the function.
     - `int key`: This parameter holds the value to be inserted into the new node.
     - `Node* newNode = new Node;`: A new `Node` object is dynamically allocated in memory using `new`.
     - `newNode->data = key`: The data field (`data`) of the new node is assigned the value of `key`.
     - `newNode->prev = nullptr`: Since this node becomes the new head, its `prev` pointer is set to `nullptr` (no previous element).
     - `newNode->next = head`: The new node's `next` pointer is set to point to the previous head (which becomes the second node after insertion).
     - `if (head != nullptr)`: Checks if the list was not empty before insertion.
       - `head->prev = newNode;`: If not empty, the previous head's `prev` pointer is updated to point to the newly inserted node, establishing the two-way link.
     - `head = newNode;`: Finally, the `head` pointer itself is updated to point to the newly inserted node, reflecting the new beginning of the list.

**6. Function `traverseRightToLeft` (`void traverseRightToLeft(Node* head)`)**
   - This function prints the contents of the linked list from the rightmost node to the leftmost node.
     - `Node* head`: This parameter takes a pointer to the head of the linked list (`head`).
     - `Node* current = head;`: A temporary pointer `current` is created to traverse the list, starting at the head.
     - `while (current != nullptr)`: A loop continues as long as `current` is not `nullptr` (not the end of the list yet). Inside the loop:
       - `cout << current->data << " ";`: The data of the current node pointed to by `current` is printed.
       - `current = current->next;`: However, since we want to traverse from right to left, the `next` pointer (unused for this traversal) is used here to move to the previous node in the list for printing. This works because the nodes are still linked in the correct order for right-to-left access.
     - `cout << endl;`: A newline character is printed after the list elements.

**7. Main Function (`int main()`)**
   - This is the entry point of the program execution.
     - `Node* head = nullptr;`: A head pointer for the linked list is initialized to `nullptr`, indicating an empty list at the start.
     - Four calls to `addNode`: These calls create new nodes with values 3, 5, 8, and 2, and insert them at the beginning (rightmost position) of the list using the `addNode` function, effectively building the list in right-to-left order (3 being the rightmost and 2 being the leftmost).
     - `cout
