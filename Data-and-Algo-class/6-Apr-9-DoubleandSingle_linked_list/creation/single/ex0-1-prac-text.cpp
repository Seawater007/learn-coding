Absolutely, here's a breakdown of the code using classes for a doubly linked list:

**1. `#include <iostream>` and `using namespace std;`**
   - These lines are the same as the previous explanation, including the `iostream` header for input/output and bringing the `std` namespace into scope.

**2. `class Node { ... };`**
   - This defines a class named `Node`. A class is similar to a structure but offers more features like member functions (methods) to operate on the data. Here's what's inside the `Node` class:
     - `public:`: This keyword specifies that the following members are accessible from outside the class.
     - `int data;`: This member variable stores the integer data for each node.
     - `Node* next;`: This member variable is a pointer to another `Node` structure, pointing to the next node in the list.
     - `Node* prev;`: Similar to the previous code, this pointer points to the previous node in the doubly linked list.

**3. `class DoublyLinkedList { ... };`**
   - This defines a class named `DoublyLinkedList` that manages the doubly linked list operations.
     - `public:`: Similar to the `Node` class, this makes the following members accessible from outside.
     - `Node* head;`: This member variable is a pointer to a `Node` structure, representing the head (first node) of the list.
     - `DoublyLinkedList() { ... }`: This is the constructor for the `DoublyLinkedList` class. It's called whenever a new `DoublyLinkedList` object is created.
       - `head = nullptr;`: Inside the constructor, the `head` pointer is initialized to `nullptr`, indicating an empty list initially.
     - `void insertFront(int data) { ... }`: This is a member function named `insertFront`. It takes an integer `data` as input and inserts a new node with that data at the beginning of the list.
       - Similar to the previous code, it creates a new node (`newNode`), sets its `data`, `next`, and `prev` pointers, and updates the `head` pointer.
     - `void printList() { ... }`: This is another member function named `printList`. It traverses the list and prints the data of each node.
       - It uses a temporary pointer `current` to iterate through the list, printing the data and moving to the next node until the end is reached (`current == nullptr`).

**4. `int main() { ... }`**
   - This is the main function where the program execution begins.
     - `DoublyLinkedList myList;`: Creates an object named `myList` of the `DoublyLinkedList` class.
     - `myList.insertFront(3);`, `myList.insertFront(2);`, `myList.insertFront(1);`: These lines call the `insertFront` function on the `myList` object to insert nodes with values 3, 2, and 1, creating a list with 1 -> 2 -> 3.
     - `cout << "Doubly linked list: ";`, `myList.printList();`: These lines print a message and then call the `printList` function on `myList` to print the list contents.
     - `return 0;`: This indicates successful program termination.

Key improvements in this version using classes:
- Encapsulation: Data (`data`) and operations (member functions) are grouped within the `Node` and `DoublyLinkedList` classes, promoting better organization.
- Object-oriented approach: The code interacts with the linked list through the `myList` object, making it more readable and maintainable.
