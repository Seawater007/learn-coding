/*
I'd be glad to explain the code line by line:

**1. `#include <iostream>`**
   - This line includes the `iostream` header file, which provides essential functionalities for input/output operations in C++. It allows you to use objects like `cin` for input and `cout` for output.

**2. `using namespace std;`**
   - This line brings the `std` namespace into scope, making it easier to use standard C++ objects and functions without having to prefix them with `std::`. It's generally recommended to avoid this in larger projects but acceptable for small examples like this.

**3. `int main() {`**
   - This line defines the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program. All C++ programs must have a `main` function. The `int` return type indicates that the function will return an integer value (usually 0 to signal successful execution).

**4. `int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};`**
   - This line declares an integer array named `arr` and initializes it with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

**5. `int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);`**
   - This line calculates the size of the array `arr`. Here's how it works:
     - `sizeof(arr)`: This expression gives the total number of bytes occupied by the entire array `arr`. In C++, arrays decay to pointers when passed to expressions or functions. So, `sizeof(arr)` will return the size of a pointer to an integer (which is typically 4 bytes on most systems).
     - `sizeof(arr[0])`: This expression gives the size of a single element (an integer) in the array.
     - The division `sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0])` calculates the number of elements in the array by dividing the total size of the array by the size of each element. This is a common technique to get the size of an array in C++ when it's declared directly with its elements.

**6. `int *ptr = arr;`**
   - This line declares an integer pointer named `ptr` and initializes it to point to the first element of the array `arr`. The asterisk (`*`) before `ptr` indicates that it's a pointer variable.

**7. `int sum = 0;`**
   - This line declares an integer variable named `sum` and initializes it to 0. It will be used to accumulate the sum of the array elements.

**8. `while (ptr < arr + size) {`**
   - This line starts a `while` loop that will continue iterating as long as the condition `ptr < arr + size` is true.
     - `ptr`: This is the pointer variable that's currently pointing to an element in the array.
     - `arr + size`: This expression adds the size of the array (number of elements) to the address of the first element `arr`. This effectively points to the element just beyond the last element in the array.
   - So, the loop continues as long as `ptr` hasn't reached the end of the array.

**9. `sum += *ptr;`**
   - This line is the core of the calculation.
     - `*ptr`: This dereferences the pointer `ptr`, which means it accesses the value that the pointer is currently pointing to (the element in the array it's referencing).
     - `sum += *ptr`: This adds the value pointed to by `ptr` to the current value of `sum`. In each iteration, this effectively adds the next element in the array to the running total.

**10. `ptr++;`**
   - This line increments the pointer `ptr` by 1. Pointers store memory addresses, so incrementing a pointer moves it to point to the next element in the array (since elements are typically stored contiguously in memory).

**11. `}` (end of the while loop)**
   - This curly brace marks the end of the `while` loop. The loop will continue iterating as long as `ptr` hasn't reached the end of the array (as checked in the condition).

**12. `cout << "Sum of array elements: " << sum << endl;`**
   - This line prints the final value of `sum` (the calculated sum of all elements in the array) to the console.
     - `cout`: This is the standard output stream object from the `iostream` header.
     - `"Sum of array elements: "`: This is
