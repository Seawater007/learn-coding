/*
I'd be glad to explain the code line by line:

**1. `#include <iostream>`**

- This line is a preprocessor directive that instructs the compiler to include the contents of the `<iostream>` header file.
- The `<iostream>` header file provides essential input and output functionalities in C++, such as the `cout` object for printing to the console and the `cin` object for reading input from the user.

**2. `using namespace std;`**

- This line brings the `std` namespace into scope for the current code block.
- The C++ Standard Library defines many functions and objects within the `std` namespace. By using this line, you can avoid repeatedly writing `std::` before standard library elements like `cout` and `cin`.
- **Note:** While convenient, using `using namespace std;` can sometimes lead to naming conflicts if you have custom functions or variables with the same names as standard library elements. It's generally recommended to be more explicit with `std::` for better code organization and to avoid potential issues.

**3. `bool isEvenNumber(int num) {`**

- This line declares a function named `isEvenNumber` that takes an integer (`int`) argument named `num` and returns a boolean (`bool`) value.
- The function body is enclosed within curly braces `{}`.

**4. `return num % 2 == 0;`**

- This line is the return statement of the `isEvenNumber` function.
- It calculates the remainder (`%`) when `num` is divided by 2.
- If the remainder is 0, the number is even, so the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

**5. `}`**

- This closing curly brace marks the end of the `isEvenNumber` function.

**6. `void countEvenOddNumbers(int arr[], int n) {`**

- This line declares a function named `countEvenOddNumbers` that takes two arguments:
    - `int arr[]`: An integer array passed by reference (more on this later).
    - `int n`: An integer representing the size of the array.
- The function has a `void` return type, meaning it doesn't return any value.

**7. `int evenCount = 0;`**

- This line declares an integer variable named `evenCount` and initializes it to 0. It will be used to store the count of even numbers in the array.

**8. `int oddCount = 0;`**

- This line declares an integer variable named `oddCount` and initializes it to 0. It will be used to store the count of odd numbers in the array.

**9. `for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {`**

- This line starts a `for` loop that iterates through the elements of the array.
    - The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0.
    - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n` (the size of the array).
    - `++i` increments the value of `i` by 1 after each iteration.

**10. `if (isEvenNumber(arr[i])) {`**

- This line checks if the element at index `i` of the array (`arr[i]`) is even using the `isEvenNumber` function.

**11. `evenCount++;`**

- If the condition in the `if` statement is true (the element is even), this line increments the `evenCount` variable by 1.

**12. `} else {`**

- This line marks the `else` block of the `if` statement.

**13. `oddCount++;`**

- If the element at index `i` is not even (the `if` condition is false), this line increments the `oddCount` variable by 1.

**14. `}`**

- This closing curly brace marks the end of the `if` statement's `else` block.

**15. `}`**

- This closing curly brace marks the end of the `for` loop.

**16. `cout << "Even numbers: " << evenCount << endl;`**

- This line prints a message to the console indicating the count of even numbers, using the `cout` object from the `iostream` header and the `endl` manipulator to add a newline character.

**17. `cout << "Odd numbers: " << oddCount << endl;`**

- This line prints a message to the console indicating the count of odd numbers.

**18. `}`**

The `main` function you provided is the entry point of the C++ program. It's responsible for taking user input, creating an array, and calling the `countEvenOddNumbers` function to process the data. Here's a breakdown of the code line by line:

**1. `int main() {`**

- This line declares the `main` function, which is the starting point of execution for most C++ programs.
- The `int` return type indicates that the function will return an integer value (usually 0 to signal successful execution).

**2. `int n;`**

- This line declares an integer variable named `n` to store the size of the array that will be entered by the user.

**3. `cout << "Enter the size of the array: ";`**

- This line prints a message to the console asking the user to enter the size of the array.
- `cout` is the standard output stream object from the `<iostream>` header.

**4. `cin >> n;`**

- This line reads the integer value entered by the user and stores it in the `n` variable.
- `cin` is the standard input stream object from the `<iostream>` header.

**5. `int arr[n];`**

- This line declares an integer array named `arr` with a size determined by the value of `n` entered by the user.
- This creates an array in memory that can hold `n` integer elements.

**6. `cout << "Enter " << n << " integers: ";`**

- This line prints a message to the console instructing the user to enter `n` integers (the size of the array).

**7. `for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {`**

- This line starts a `for` loop that iterates `n` times, which is the size of the array.
    - The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0.
    - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
    - `++i` increments the value of `i` by 1 after each iteration.

**8. `cin >> arr[i];`**

- Inside the `for` loop, this line reads an integer value entered by the user and stores it in the element at index `i` of the `arr` array.
- Each iteration of the loop allows the user to enter one value for the array.

**9. `}`**

- This closing curly brace marks the end of the `for` loop.

**10. `countEvenOddNumbers(arr, n);`**

- This line calls the previously defined `countEvenOddNumbers` function.
    - The first argument (`arr`) is the integer array that was created and filled with user input. Since arrays are passed by reference in C++, the function can directly access and modify the elements of the array.
    - The second argument (`n`) is the size of the array, which is needed by the `countEvenOddNumbers` function to iterate through the elements correctly.

**11. `return 0;`**

- This line returns the value 0 from the `main` function.
- A return value of 0 typically indicates successful program execution in C++.

In summary, the `main` function guides the user to enter the size of the array, creates the array, allows the user to fill it with integer values, and then calls the `countEvenOddNumbers` function to process the array and print the counts of even and odd numbers.
