/*
The code you provided defines a function to check if a matrix is an identity matrix and then uses it to test two example matrices. Here's a line-by-line explanation:

**1. `#include <iostream>` and `#include <vector>`:**

- These lines include necessary header files from the C++ Standard Library.
    - `<iostream>` provides input/output functionalities (like `cout` for printing).
    - `<vector>` defines the `vector` class used to represent multi-dimensional arrays.

**2. `using namespace std;`:**

- This line avoids repeatedly writing `std::` before standard library elements like `cout` and `vector`. However, overuse of `using namespace std;` can lead to naming conflicts in larger projects.

**3. `bool isIdentityMatrix(const vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {`:**

- This line defines a function named `isIdentityMatrix`.
    - `bool` indicates the function returns a boolean value (true or false).
    - `const vector<vector<int>>& matrix` defines the function's parameter: a constant reference to a 2D vector of integers (`vector<vector<int>>`). The `const` keyword ensures the function doesn't modify the input matrix.

**4-5. `int rows = matrix.size();` and `int cols = matrix[0].size();`:**

- These lines get the dimensions of the input matrix.
    - `matrix.size()` returns the number of rows (inner vectors) in the matrix.
    - `matrix[0].size()` gets the size of the first row (number of columns) assuming all rows have the same size in an identity matrix.

**6. `if (rows != cols) { return false; }`:**

- This checks if the number of rows (`rows`) is equal to the number of columns (`cols`).
    - If not, the matrix cannot be an identity matrix, so the function returns `false`.

**7-14. Nested `for` loops to iterate through the matrix:**

- These loops iterate through each element of the matrix using two nested loops:
    - The outer loop (`for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i)`) iterates through each row (`i` being the row index).
    - The inner loop (`for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j)`) iterates through each element in a row (`j` being the column index).

**8-11. Checking diagonal and off-diagonal elements:**

- `if (i == j)`: Checks if we're on a diagonal element (where row index `i` equals column index `j`).
    - `if (matrix[i][j] != 1)`: If it's a diagonal element, it should have a value of 1. If not, the matrix is not an identity matrix, so the function returns `false`.
- `else`: If it's not a diagonal element, it should have a value of 0.
    - `if (matrix[i][j] != 0)`: If it's not a diagonal element and not 0, the matrix is not an identity matrix, so the function returns `false`.

**15. `return true;`:**

- If the loop completes without finding any non-conforming elements, all conditions for an identity matrix are met, so the function returns `true`.

**16. `int main() {`:**

- This line defines the `main` function, the program's entry point.

**17-21. Creating two example matrices:**

- Two example matrices (`matrix1` and `matrix2`) are created using nested initializers within `vector` declarations.
    - `matrix1` is a 3x3 identity matrix.
    - `matrix2` is similar to `matrix1` but has a 2 in the bottom right corner, making it not an identity matrix.

**22-25. Calling the `isIdentityMatrix` function and printing results:**

- The `isIdentityMatrix` function is called with each example matrix.
    - The ternary operator (`? :`) is used for a concise way to print "True" or "False" based on the function's return value.

**26. `return 0;`:**

- This line indicates successful program execution (standard way to end `main`).

Overall, this code defines a function to check if a given matrix is an identity matrix and uses it to test two example matrices.
